# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "ENHANCED KML PARSER ROBUSTNESS TESTING COMPLETE: Conducted comprehensive testing of the enhanced KML parser as specifically requested in Portuguese review. Tested 8 different KML scenarios with 100% success rate: ✅ Simple KML (Brasília) with basic Placemark structure - correctly parsed names, descriptions, coordinates. ✅ KML with ExtendedData - properly extracted Data elements with name/value pairs (tipo: Torre, codigo: CN19-001) and integrated into description. ✅ Multiple Placemarks - successfully parsed 2 locations simultaneously. ✅ Invalid Coordinates Validation - correctly rejected out-of-range coordinates (-200,100) with proper error message. ✅ Invalid XML Structure - properly rejected malformed XML with mismatched tags. ✅ Non-KML File Extension - correctly rejected .txt files with appropriate error. ✅ UTF-8 Encoding with BOM - preserved accented characters (Localização, São Paulo, Brasília, João Pessoa). ✅ Different Coordinate Formats - supports coordinates with/without altitude values. The robust parser handles various encodings, validates coordinate ranges (-180≤lng≤180, -90≤lat≤90), extracts ExtendedData/SimpleData elements correctly, and provides comprehensive error handling. All KML parsing functionality working as expected with enhanced robustness."

      message: "CN19 KML PARSER FINAL VALIDATION COMPLETE: Successfully tested the exact CN19 KML example provided in the Portuguese review request. ✅ PERFECT PERFORMANCE: The robust KML parser flawlessly processed the complex CN19 KML containing 2 Placemarks (Torre CN19-001 and Estação Base CN19-002) with ExtendedData elements. All coordinates parsed correctly (-15.7942,-47.8825 and -15.8267,-47.9156), ExtendedData properly extracted (tipo, codigo, status), Portuguese descriptions preserved, and all CRUD operations (upload, list 4874 locations, delete) working perfectly. Additional robustness testing confirmed: ✅ Non-KML file rejection (.txt files blocked), ✅ UTF-8 encoding with accents preserved, ✅ Authentication requirements enforced (403 Forbidden for unauthorized access). The KML parser demonstrates enterprise-grade robustness and successfully handles complex real-world KML files as requested. All functionality operational and ready for production use."
